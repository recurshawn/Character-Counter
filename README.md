# Character Counter
Python program that takes in a message and counts the number of occurrences of each letter and displays results systematically.

Wrote this code to learn how dictionaries and lists can be used in Python.

## Future scope
* Make this into a useable function for future projects like Huffman Encoding etc.
* Please suggest more ideas
